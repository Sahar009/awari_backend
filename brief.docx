🏡 Project Brief: AWARI Projects – Real Estate & Shortlet Platform

The platform allows property listing, booking, inspection scheduling, payments, reviews, and user management in a seamless, secure, and scalable way.

Allow landlords/agents to list, manage, and monetize properties.

Provide hotel providers with a shortlet management dashboard.

Enable secure payments, inspections, and document verification.

Give admins tools to monitor, approve, and manage the entire ecosystem.
